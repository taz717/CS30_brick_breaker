# brickBreak

##This is a brick breaking game >:(

it uses OOP to make objects and with the use of functions, we detect collisions
and bounces depending on where the collision was. The bounces act as triggers
to either start the new level, end the game, quit, add score or simply lose
a life.


##Added Features
There is a speed modifier to make the game harder as it goes by
(0.0007* modifier to be exact)

There is a life system. Three hits and you are out.

##Planning

##instructions

simply run the program and press space to start. You get
10 points per hit and three lives so you better make them count.
once you hit the first 32 blocks another 8 will spawn for lvl 2 which are
oddly placed to make the game frustrating.

Now to exit the game at any point simply press ESC.

Once again 10PT/hit for score
